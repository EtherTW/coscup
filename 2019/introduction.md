# Description / expectations of your Community Room
Blockchain enpowers a decentralized and trustless world. It is a combination of several fields such as cryptography, consensus algorithm and economic models. Since Satoshi Nakamoto published Bitcoin on 2008, there were countless technology rised and developed. Among those, the advanced technology such as Ethereum Smart Contract, Proof of Stake, Zero-knowledge Proof, and sharding are getting more mature. We would like to sincerely invite submissions from academia, industry and any individual who are intereted in this area. These topics include, but are not limited to:
- Sharding
- Performance, Scalability Issues
- Security and Privacy Issues
- Zero Knowledge Proof
- Consensus Algorithms
- Blockchain-based Applications
- Decentralized App Development
- Smart Contracts
- Regulations and Policies in Cryptocurrency
- Token Economy
- Decentralized Internet Infrastructure

區塊鏈由密碼學、共識演算法以及經濟模型等不同領域結合而來的技術，具備信任以及去中心化等的特性．而自2008年中本聰發表比特幣以來，許多的技術興起以及發展；其中，以太坊的智能合約、權益證明以及零知識證明等等的新技術也越來越成熟．我們在此邀請學術界、產業界或是任何對於區塊鏈有興趣的獨立工作者投稿，而相關的題目內容請參考以下但不僅限於此類：
